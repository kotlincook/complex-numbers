# complex-numbers
Math interface for complex numbers including the four basic arithmetic operations + - * / and 
typical functions like exp, sin, cos, etc.

## Special feature
The highlight of this interface is, that it provides the functions mentioned above as default 
implementations, but these functions can be easily replaced (overwritten) by a class that 
forwards the calculation to the routines of the apache common package for example.
